*           History            *
********************************

This application is a concept I started a couple years back for my EVE Online corporation (RIP Eternity Enterprises, Ltd.) that I have been steadily leeaving and returning to over time.  Originally, all of our corporation's financial management was accomplished via a massive Excel spreadsheet workbook that I had created, and as I updated and released new versions of the workbook, it became a hassle for me to ensure that all the managers were using the most up-to-date version.  Another problem was that it was a *Microsoft* Excel spreadsheet, which (at the time) forced all the managers to use Microsoft Office because there were some features (e.g. comments) that were unsupported in popular free alternatives like OpenOffice.org (at the time).

I began developing the application in the hopes of streamlining our management process, but I became considerably busier and have also had to leave EVE Online.  However, this application was still a great project to introduce myself to more detailed web programming than I had been doing prior (I learned a considerable amount about AJAX on this project), and it now serves me as an experimental coding sandbox.

*        Directory Tree        *
********************************
|eve   :: Root folder containing the primary files of the application.
|-----css   :: Contains all of the files for styling (i.e. CSS files).
|-----img   :: Contains all of the image files (which isn't much, as I was focused more on business logic).
|-----js    :: Contains all of the JavaScript files.
|-----mysql :: Contains the MySQL workbench database model as well as all the scripts for populating the MySQL database for the application.
|-----test  :: Contains all of the "unit test" files.  They may not actually be fully written unit test suites, but all of the testing code goes here.
|-----xml   :: Contains obsolete XML files I keep around for historical purposes.
|-----xsl   :: Contains the XSL files to style the XML returned from the PHP scripts.

********************************
*         Requirements         *
********************************
~ PHP 5.3 with the mysqli and PDO APIs.
~ MySQL 5.x.

********************************
*           Optional           *             
********************************
~ MySQL Workbench: For the database models I stuffed in the mysql folder.

********************************
*            Setup             *
********************************
To set up the database, create a MySQL database called 'eve'.  Then, run these scripts from top-to-bottom order:
~ create_eve_tables.sql
~ populate_eve_item_category_table.sql
~ populate_eve_item_type_table.sql
~ populate_eve_item_table.sql

A centralized configuration setup is in the works, but for now, if you want to edit the credentials for logging into your MySQL database, look in DatabaseConnection.php.
